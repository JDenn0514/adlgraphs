Description: The goal of adlgraphs is to to help ensure that the data 
    visualizations produced by the Center for Antisemitism Research (CAR) at the
    Anti-Defamation League (ADL) are consistent with ADL's brand guidelines and 
    that CAR's data visualizations are consistent and cohesive. In addition, it 
    contains a myriad array of different functions to help make data analysis 
    and data cleaning quicker, easier, and more succinct.
