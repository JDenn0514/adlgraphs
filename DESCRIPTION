Description: The main goal of adlgraphs is toward improving the efficiency and 
    ease of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing survey data, so that the 
    turnaround time between data collection and presentation of analysis and 
    findings could be as minimized as much as possible. In addition, this has 
    ensured that the presentation of data and results is consistent across 
    projects.
