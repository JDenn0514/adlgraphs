\title{Calculate weighted standard deviation}
\usage{
wtd_sd(x, wt = NULL, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector that you want to calculate the SD}

\item{wt}{A numeric vector indicating the weights used in the calculation}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. Indicates if NAs should be removed or not}
}
\description{
While this is mainly an
internal function, it is available for everyone since I could not find
a function that calculates a weighted standard deviation.
}
\details{
Thank you to the team at Hmisc for the creation of \code{\link[Hmisc:wtd.stats]{Hmisc::wtd.var()}}.
This function could not have been created without it. I simplified their
source code and then took the square root.
