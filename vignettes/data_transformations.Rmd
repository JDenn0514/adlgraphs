```{r, include = FALSE}

```


`adlgraphs` provides four main functions to reduce the amount of time it takes to perform a few very common data transformations:

- `flip_val() - flips the valence of a vector

- `num_rev()` - reverses the values of a vector

- `make_dicho()` - converts a vector to a dichotomous factor

- `make_binary()` - converts a vector to a binary (0 and 1)

## `num_rev()` and `flip_val()`

Let's create a vector called `blue` that measures people's agreement with the statement "I like the color blue" and set it so that a higher number means more disagreement.

```{r}

# create the vector
blue <- sample(c(1:4), size = 20, replace = TRUE)
# add value labels
attr(blue, "labels") <- c(
  "Strongly agree" = 1, 
  "Somewhat agree" = 2, 
  "Somewhat disagree" = 3, 
  "Strongly disagree" = 4
)
# add a variable label
attr(blue, "label") <- "I like the color blue"

# make it a haven-labelled object (this is just for printing purposes)
class(blue) <- c("haven_labelled", "vctrs_vctr", "double")

# show the output and attributes
str(blue)

```

Now, given the way the statement is written, we would naturally assume a higher number means more agreement and therefore the person likes blue more. However, that's not the case. This is particularly relevant when comparing means or running regressions, etc. To fix this, we just need to reverse the values and their associated labels to show that a higher number means more agreement. This is what `num_rev()` does. 

Looking at the example below, we can see that the labels for the two vectors are reversed and the values are different as well. However, the variable labels for both are the same. Doing it this way ensures that the overall output of the question stays the same. We still get the same percentage of people who agree and disagree, but the actual numbers that underlie the variable have reversed. 


```{r}
# reverse the direction of the scale
blue_rev <- num_rev(blue)
# let's compare the two
str(list(blue = blue, blue_rev = blue_rev))

```

Conversely, if we wanted to show how much people dislike the color blue, we could show how many people disagree with the statement, however this is not as intuitive as simply showing agreement with a negative statement. To fix this proble, we could flip the valence of the question to something like, "I dislike the color blue" and change the value labels, while keep the values the same. This is what `flip_val()` does.

Looking below, we can see that the values between `blue` and `blue_flip` are the same, but the value labels and variable labels are different. Similarly, we can see that the values and variable labels between `blue_flip` and `blue_rev` are different, but their value labels are the same. 

```{r}
blue_flip <- flip_val(blue, "I dislike the color blue")
str(list(blue = blue, blue_rev = blue_rev, blue_flip = blue_flip))
```
