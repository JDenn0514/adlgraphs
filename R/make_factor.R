#' Convert a labelled vector into a factor
#'
#' @description
#'
#' `make_factor()` takes a labelled vector and converts it to a factor variable
#' using the value labels. This works with numeric, character, and factor vectors.
#'
#' This function is very similar to [`haven::as_factor()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/as_factor.html)
#' and
#' [`sjlabelled::as_label()`](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjlabelled/reference/as_label.html)
#' and is heavily based on both. However, it has some key differences. The main
#' difference compared to both functions  is that `make_factor()` adds a
#' "transformation" attribute to the new variable  indicating how it was
#' created. You can see this in the examples.
#'
#' Compared to [`sjlabelled::as_label()`](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjlabelled/reference/as_label.html)
#' it is not as extensive. For example, while [`sjlabelled::as_label()`](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjlabelled/reference/as_label.html)
#' works with data.frames and vectors, `make_factor()` only works with vectors.
#' In addition, [`sjlabelled::as_label()`](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjlabelled/reference/as_label.html)
#' has many different arguments that enable you to control the appearance of the
#' labels, NAs, and other things. `make_factor()` on the other hand is much
#' simpler. Similarly,
#' [`haven::as_factor()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/as_factor.html)
#' also enables more customization over the output of the labels. Another key
#' difference between this function and those is that if there are values without
#' labels, this function returns an error.

#'
#' @param x A vector with value labels. Can be numeric, character, or a factor
#' @param ordered Logical. Determines if the factor be ordered. Defaults to `TRUE.`
#' @param drop_levels Logical. Determines if unused factor levels should be dropped.
#'   Defaults to `TRUE.`
#' @param force Logical. Determines if `x` should be forced to a vector even
#'   if there are no value labels. Defaults to `TRUE.`
#' @param na.rm Logical. Determines if tags should be removed from NAs. Defaults
#'   to `FALSE`.
#'
#' @returns A factor vector of same length as `x`.
