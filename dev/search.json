However, instead operating factors, num_rev() operates numeric vectors. Let’s take look operates practice. , let’s look variable top data set test_data. can see, survey respondents saw positively valanced statement, “feel comfortable buying products Israel”, values ranging 1 4 1 = Strongly agree 4 = Strongly disagree. survey research, often reverse variable. primarily done two reasons. first want flip valence question. One reason might case wanted create index summing variables. statements negatively valanced, may best interest keep value labels reverse valance top can now interpreted “feel comfortable buying products Israel.” Since value labels don’t change, people previously classified “Strongly agree” now going classified “Strongly disagree”, etc. second reason one might reverse values, change direction scale. example, values top increase, one’s level disagreement. might want reverse values now 1 = “Strongly disagree” 4 = “Strongly agree”, thus higher number means agreement. method flip valance question, people originally classified “Strongly agree” still going classified “Strongly agree”. Put another way, question isn’t changing therefore people’s responses aren’t changing. thing changes value associated response. num_rev() designed second goal mind. Normally simply reversing values subtracting , underlying metadata attributes lost. result, reverse values, update value labels set variable label . really time consuming. purpose num_rev() fix automating process reversing numeric vector maintaining variable value labels. addition, function adds new attribute called transformation describes data transformation used create variable. ’m now going show function action. can see top = 1, top_rev = 4; top = 2, top_rev = 3; top = 3, top_rev = 2; top = 4, top_rev = 1. function lot just 5 - top. Let’s take look. Using str() can see variables “label” “labels” attributes top_rev new attribute called “transformation”. new “transformation” attribute automatically added describes sort data transformation variable underwent created. valuable case forgot created. addition, variables variable label seen “label” attribute. key difference can found “labels” attribute. top_rev, labels reversed. original variable, top, 1 = “Strongly agree”, 2 = “Somewhat agree”, etc. However, new variable 4 = “Strongly agree”, 3 = “Somewhat agree”, etc. Now, two reasons different labels significant. First, means check frequencies variables get results. difference order response options. Second, means variable different. top, higher score means disagreement.
